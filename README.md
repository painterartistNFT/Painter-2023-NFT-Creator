üé® How do I create NFT art?
Using Painter 2023 you can create several different types of NFT art. The first method, "Style Transfer," is good for turning photos into beautiful pieces of digital art. The second method, "Text to Image," lets you create incredible works of NFT art from just a text cue. To get started on your digital NFT design, click "Create" on the NightCafe main menu, and then select your preferred creation method. Our NFT generator will help you create NFTs that you can then sell.

üóÇ Can I create an NFT collection using Painter?
Yes, you can create an NFT collection using our NFT generator! Using Painter, you can create a series of works centered around a theme and then upload those works and upload them to the NFT minting platform of your choice to create a collection. For an example of what other Painter users have done , read this blog post about 3 Painter 2023 users and their NFT journeys.

üí∏ What does NFT mean?
NFT stands for Non-fungible Token. "Non-fungible" means that each token is unique and not interchangeable with another. In contrast, a "fungible" token can be interchanged with any other token. For example, currency is interchangeable: one dollar = one dollar, but works of art are not interchangeable; they are unique, and one work of art is not interchangeable with another. NFT creators create unique digital artworks placed on a blockchain, making them non-transferable.

üõ†Ô∏è Can I sell NFTs on Painter Creator?
No, Painter is the artificial intelligence generator used to create NFT artwork. You can then sell these works on a third-party NFT marketplace of your choice. Not sure how or where to sell? Google "how to sell NFT art?" Once you've minted your NFT on another platform, you can share it with the Painter community and provide a link where other users can purchase the NFT.

üèÜ What's the best application for creating NFTs?
It depends on the type of NFT you want to create. It is common in the NFT field to create NFT character collections that are based on an overall "base" character, with different "layers" (hats, noses, clothing, etc.) that define the personality of the character.

Painter does NOT create such NFT collections. Painter knows how to create collections in which each piece is completely unique (not based on a common base layer) and created from scratch. This makes our NFT creation app a great option for artists who want unique NFTs.

If you want to create an NFT collection from a set of layers, there are plenty of NFT generators online that can do that. But if you want to create a collection of completely unique NFTs, Painter artificial intelligence algorithms combined with our NFT generation tools are the best choice.

üíµ Is using Painter Creator worth the money?
You can use Painter Creator for free to create up to 5 NFT works per day. To create more NFT works, you can purchase a credit package - no subscription required.

üí∏ How much does it cost to create an NFT?
When creating NFTs, artists should consider two costs. The first is the cost of creating the illustration. In Painter, you can use your daily free credits to create an illustration every day for free, or you can buy a package of credits if you want to create NFTs in large quantities. A good NFT artwork usually costs 3-5 credits, and the cost varies from 20c/credit to less than 5c/credit, depending on the size of the credit package you choose.

The second cost to consider is the cost of minting the illustration to turn it into an NFT. The cost of mining NFT depends on the blockchain you choose (e.g. Ethereum, Tezos, etc.) and the "gas" prices for that blockchain at the time you mine NFT. Depending on the blockchain you choose and the gas price, NFT mining can cost anywhere from FREE, a few cents to over $100.

üì± What platforms does NightCafe Creator work on?
Painter Creator works online and can be installed on the home screen of your iPhone, Android phone or tablet.

üñºÔ∏è Do I own the artwork I create?
Yes! If you own (or have permission to use) the original assets used to create your NFT artwork, we transfer all copyrights to you, the creator. Please check the copyright laws in your country to make sure. Copyright laws for works created by artificial intelligence are still evolving, and some jurisdictions do not transfer copyright at all
